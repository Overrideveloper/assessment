# Database
A database is an organized collection of data, stored and accessed electronically. The major factors concerned in building a database is the type of data, size and relationship that exist between data. A well-structured database does the following:
- Saves disk space by eliminating redundant data
- Maintains data accuracy and integrity
- Provides access to the data

**Relational database**
----------------------------------------
A relational database is a structured collection of information that is related to a particular subject or purpose such as an inventory database or a human resources database. Within the database, you organize the data into storage containers called tables. Tables are made up of columns and rows. Columns represent individual fields in a table. Rows represent records of data in a table.
Virtually all relational database systems use SQL (Structured Query Language) as the language for querying and maintaining the database. Popular relational databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite3, etc.

**Non-Relational database**
----------------------------------------
A non-relational database or NoSQL database does not incorporate the table/key model but stores data without explicit and structured mechanisms to link data from different tables (or buckets) to one another. Examples of NoSQL include MongoDB, Redis, etc.
