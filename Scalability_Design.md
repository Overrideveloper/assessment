# Scalability
Scalability is the capability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. For example, a system is considered scalable if it is capable of increasing its total output under an increased load when resources (typically hardware) are added.

**Horizontal scaling Vs Vertical scaling**
----------------------------------------
The basic meaning of horizontal scaling is that systems are "built out" using additional components. By contrast, the term "vertical scaling" means that extra capability and resources are added to one single component. One common example of both of these kinds of scalability involves a hardware server. Suppose that network demand means a server has to handle significantly more data transfers. IT managers could add processing power or memory to the single server to increase its capability, or they could link it to other servers. The former approach illustrates vertical scaling while the latter illustrates horizontal scaling.

**How scaling impacts company goals**
-----------------------------------
Scaling could impact company goals in variety of ways depending on the goals of the company and the importance of the system been scaled to the companies goals. Scaling could have very dire consequences if not managed properly. Examples include
1. Paying excesses for hardware which are not in use or doing not provide any benefits to the system.
2. Poor scaling could also mean that the system would not be able to perform optimally under certain condition which could impact service delivery.

**Short-term scalability considerations Vs Long-term scalability considerations**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scaling designs largely depends on the system been scaled and overall objective of the system. Often times vertical scaling are considered for short term as they are cheap and quite easy to implement. This form of scaling is often performed as the system grows. On the other hand horizontal scaling is often considered for long term and is quite expensive. As might have been noticed, vertical scaling is often limited to the capacity of a single machine, scaling beyond that capacity often involves downtime and comes with an upper limit. In these scenarios it is helpful one anticipates the potential size and growth of the system being scaled.

**Load testing**
--------------
Load testing is performed to determine how a system's performance changes under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions. It helps to identify the maximum operating capacity of an application as well as any bottlenecks and determine which element is causing degradation.

**Autoscaling**
-------------
This refers to a systems ability to automatically adjust computational capacity to maintain a steady and predictable performance.
