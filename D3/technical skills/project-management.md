# Project Management
### Expectation
The Developer is able to use a project management tool to effectively manage the work done by a team of developers by working with them to ensure that all tasks are identified & tracked, that changes are updated on stories, and that statuses are effectively used to keep everyone informed.

### Justification
On my current engagement, we currently use GITLAB issue tracker as our project management tool to create tickets/tasks. We previously used Trello to as well but moved to GITLAB to facilitate correct tracking of PRs to tickets.

When creating tickets, I ensure I give a detailed description of the problem and acceptance criteria and also try to give possible pointers or where to check in case of bugs.

Over the course of my time at Andela, I have also used various project management tools, ranging from pivotal tracker while on LENKEN during apprenticeship, bugzilla (with Mozilla Balrog) during simulations and Trello (during bootcamp).
