# 2 & 3 Tier Architecture
### Expectation
The Developer has a thorough understanding of multi-tier architecture and is able to guide a team in the intricacies of its development.

### Justification
A Multi-tier (N-Tier) Application program is one that is distributed among three or more separate computers, each having a distinct and clear function in a distributed network.

The most common form of n-tier is the 3-tier Application, and it is classified into three categories.

1. User interface programming in the user's computer
2. Business logic in a more centralized computer, and
3. Required data in a computer that manages a database.

#### 3-Tier Architecture
3-tier architecture has three different layers, which are:

1. **Presentation layer (Presentation Tier):** The top-most level of the application is the user interface. The main purpose of the interface is to translate tasks and results to something the user can understand.
2. **Business Logic layer (Logic tier):** This layer coordinates the application, processes commands, makes logical decisions and evaluations, and performs calculations. It also moves and processes data between the two surrounding layers.
3. **Database layer (Data tier):** Here information is stored and retrieved from a database or file system. The information is then passed back to the logic tier for processing, and then eventually back to the user.
