# Ownership

### Expectation
The Developer takes full ownership of delivering all work outputs as well as managing the team to deliver on work outputs within defined timelines. They also strive to ensure consistent delivery by resolving conflict amongst team members.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I am the most experienced Andela on both the UI and API project. I am currently responsible for ensuring other team members understand the scope of the task assigned. Breaking down tickets that I perceive to be too big and also answer questions CTO or other stakeholders might have concerning the two projects. I have also been given the responsibility of reviewing PRs on both projects.
