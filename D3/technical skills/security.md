# Security

### Expectation
The Developer is adept at implementing both transport and message level security in web applications. They should also have an understanding of the Application Security Verification Standard (OWASP).

### Justification
One of the security risks of a typical web application is that sending data back and forth between systems makes it susceptible to interception. There are two main ways we can prevent this type of intervention and they include:

1. **Transport level security** is a security protocol based on the Secure Sockets layer or Transport layer security (SSL/TLS) which runs beneath the HTTP protocol which is the underlying protocol used by the World Wide Web and this protocol defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. Implementing security at the transport level means securing the network protocol with HTTPS and ensuring the encryption, integrity, and privacy of communications between all systems involved through SSL certificates.

2. **Message Level Security**  is an application layer service and facilitates the protection of data between applications by sending security information along with the message/data been sent. For example, a portion of the message may be signed by a sender and encrypted for a particular receiver. Message level security doesn’t utilise SSL/TSL and is intended to work between applications. It’s most commonly used today by chat applications and email providers.

The OWASP application verification standard is an open source standard for ensuring secure measures/practices when building applications and some of these practices which I currently adhere to in my day to day tasks typically include:

**Input Validation or data validation**: it is the proper testing of any input supplied by a user or application. This prevents improperly formed data from entering the application. I ensure validating user inputs on my current engagement.

**Output Encoding**: this involves converting sensitive information from the server into a safe form where the input is displayed as safe data to the user. 

**Access Control** involves authentication and authorisation of users. This is two fold, Authentication requires managing user sessions and access to the application whereas Authorisation involves giving authenticated users different access levels to different parts of the application. I ensure that when building secure and robust I implement authentication by use of JWT tokens.

**Error Handling and Logging** involves having an error handling strategy that does not involve logging sensitive or unusable information.
