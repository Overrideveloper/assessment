# Debugging

### Expectation
The Developer is able to use their knowledge to facilitate root cause analysis across integrated components developed by the members of their team and external teams. They have the ability to diagnose problems by reverse engineering inherited code bases.

### Justification
This involves a process of diagnosing errors in your codebase and determining how best to correct them. Bugs creep into programs due to different reasons. One very common reason is not understanding the full scope of the problem the program is to solve.
The first step to fixing a bug is first reproducing the said bug. Next step would involve understanding the root cause of the bug as well as the initial problem the program was to solve before writing a fix for it. One should note that debugging by brute force is not a recommended first step approach as that would only amount to a lot of time wasting.

During my time in LevelTen engagement I have had the opportunity of debugging and providing fixes for different bugs on the LevelTen marketplace platform.
