# Decision Making

### Expectation
The Developer is able to facilitate group discussions and decision-making. They do this by controlling the flow of discussions, keeping everyone on track, ensuring that all relevant points are made and weighed as needed, and making sure the group is able to reach consensus.

### Justification
As a senior member of the team I am currently working on. I ensure I proactively participate in any decision making process. I ensure I sort team members opinions on any decision about to be made as well as listen and take note of each persons opinions in a manner that makes everyone feel their opinions are valued. I also ensure I harmonize everyones opinions in such a fashion that every decision made feels more like a collective decision and less like individual decision.

A typical example of this was when deciding what kind of test to introduces to the platform. On my current engagement we did not use to right test as I don't think my CTO is very keen on it. While I was able to push for base implementation of End-to-end testing on the UI, the API existed with no testing at all. Eventually when new team members joined the engagement we had to come up with a workflow that would have us right test and while there were many suggestions as to the kind of test we should be writing, I was able to stir the conversation with my knowledge of the code in such a fashion that we all collectively decided on building on top of the base end to end test I had and then then extending the test with other suggestions from team members.
