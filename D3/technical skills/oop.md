# Object Oriented Programming
### Expectation:
The Developer should have a very sound understanding of object relationships and be able to use this knowledge to design a complete system, taking into account the different possible users and interactions.

### Justification
Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm in which data are defined not only by type or attribute but also by their behaviors as objects. A computer program with a collection of objects modelled with clearly defined relationships with one another is said to use the OOP paradigm.

Some basic concepts of OOP I am familiar with include:


1. **Abstraction:** It basically deals with extracting common feature/functions of objects and procedures.
2. **Encapsulation:**  Encapsulation is a mechanism where you bind multiple aspects of your program to create a new entity with a single interface, essentially hiding individual parts that make up the new entity. It is closely related to Abstraction and Information hiding.
3. **Inheritance:** When one object acquires all the properties and behaviours of a parent object, it is known as inheritance. It provides code reusability. it's a feature that represents the "is a" relationship between different classes.
4. **Polymorphism** This represents the ability of an object to take many forms. An object which can pass more than one "is a" relationship test is said to be polymorphic. Polymorphism could also be expressed in the form of two or more objects from the same Parent class performing same action in different ways.

To get the most out of an object-oriented system, there are principles that must be adhered to alongside the concepts. They are called the [SOLID principles](https://github.com/andela-iikikin/assessment/blob/master/SOLID/SOLID-principles.md)

When designing a system, the rule of thumb I basically use in determining how to design my classes consist of the following:

**Responsibilities:** I divide the work into different actors, each with a different responsibility. I try to describe responsibilities using action verbs. These actors will form the classes for the program.

**Independence:** I define the work for each class to be as independent from other classes as possible. Each class has autonomy over some aspect of the program.

**Behaviours:** I define the behaviours for each class carefully and precisely, so that the consequences of each action performed by a class will be well understood by other classes that interact with it. These behaviours are simply methods that this class defines.
