# API

### Expectation
The Developer should be able to design and build complex APIs using a number of protocols (REST, XML-RPC) taking into account backwards compatibility while being able to easily implement new features.

### Justification
Application Programming Interface(API), is an intermediary that allows software applications to communicate with each other.

#### REST
[Sample Rest API](https://github.com/andela-iikikin/UrlShortener-Express-)

#### XML-RPC
The XML-RPC acronym RPC stands for Remote Procedure Call. XML-RPC is a remote procedure call that uses XML to encode calls and HTTP as a transport mechanism.
XML-RPC requests are a combination of XML content and HTTP headers. 
An XML-RPC message is an HTTP-POST request, and so there are requests and responses. The requestâ€™s body is in XML.  It returns a value, and this value is also in the XML format.
