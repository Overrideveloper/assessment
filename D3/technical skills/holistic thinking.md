#Holistic Thinking

### Expectation
The Developer is able to understand the work that needs to be delivered by multiple members of a team, see how it all fits together toward the completion of a goal, and engage with stakeholders.

### Justification
As the most experienced senior developer on my engagement. I display this skill during backlog grooming by ensuring I ask questions about possible conflicts with other parts of the application and I also ensure I explain in tail parts of the application that would possibly be affected by any feature being implemented to members of my team.

Also during PR review. I ensure I consider how each implementation might affect other parts of the application. [Evidence](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ccbL3MaKpwzHJAapaIhxC1cLW1U_V73I)
