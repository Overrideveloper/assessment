# Motivation and  Commitment

### Expectation 
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and is capable of motivating their team and maintaining their team's energy level and commitment throughout the course of a release or project.

### Justification
As a senior member of my current team, I have displayed this skill by: 

1. Public recognition and appreciation of their effort and commitment during demos and also endorsing or backing any suggestions from team members I believe could improve the team.
2. I also ensure team members who make mistakes don't feel like they been punished or neglected for trying.
3. Working with my team on a joint task. Being aware of what they are working on, and checking in on them to identify blockers and help unblock them and having pairing sessions with them, understanding blockers faced and talking through solutions on how to achieve their end goal or visualise the problem from some other perspective.
4. Stepping up during stand-ups or retrospectives to propose ideas which I think the team could benefit from.
5. Taking the lead in implementing complex features as an example of the level of commitment they should be displaying.

An example was when there was a sudden Public holiday by the Nigerian Government which would have affected our delivery time line. In other to save us the the trouble of explaining to our CTO of why we cannot deliver on the set date due to the coming holiday, I had a conversation with my team member here in Nigeria to work from home on the said day so we can deliver before the deadline with no excuses.
