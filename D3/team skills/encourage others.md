# Encourage Others

### Expectation
The Developer is able to give others support, confidence and hope. They can constructively persuade and stimulate others to continue something with strong work ethics. They show appreciation for the contributions of others, and give others credit for their work.

### Justification
As a senior member of the team on my current engagement. I ensure I acknowledge everyones contributions whenever I am leading a demo at the end of any sprint.

As a Learning facilitator for prospective Andelans who come into bootcamp I have also helped encourage those who feel overwhelmed with the weight of expectations. Some of whom almost quit the program. I was able to encourage them to continue and learn as much as they can and if they don't make it at the end, then they know they are better equipped to reapply. I have also demonstrated the skill with prospective Andelans as a fellow interviewer also.
