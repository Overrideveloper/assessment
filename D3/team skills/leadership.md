# Leadership

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates additional leadership skills such as imparting knowledge and expertise to their team, helping them to understand what needs to be built and why, and encouraging a collaborative environment.


### Justification
I have displayed great leadership skill in leading the UI and API team in development. Taking responsibilities for the success and failures on those products. Leading the break down of task along with demoing to key stakeholders in LevelTen Energy.

I have been familiar with this skill right from my apprenticeship days on Lenken. On the Lenken team, every third-month a fellow is required to lead an EPIC. I was able to lead the team in delivering an EPIC on rating mentors on the Lenken App.
