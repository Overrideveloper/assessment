# Expectations Management

### Expectation
The Developer is able to manage the expectations of others regarding the output of the team as a whole and of individual members. They are also able to manage the expectations of the team themselves.

### Justification
I have on several occasions on my current engagement displayed this skill through the following means:


1. I ensure I evaluate possible cause for delays e.g(public holidays, tasks that depend on factors beyond our control) and factor that in when estimating tasks.

2. I ensure I am in constant communication with stakeholders regarding blockers and any new situation that might impact delivery.

3. I ensure I give constructive feedback and raise concerns when necessary on our progress, motivation and development workflow.

4. I ask as much questions whenever I see requirements are ambiguous.

5. I raise concerns on unrealistic expectations, detailing my concerns.
