# Management

### Expectation
The Developer demonstrates an ability to manage junior members of their team by clearly setting expectations, by helping them to improve as developers through the delivery of prioritized, value-adding work, and by helping them grow as contributing members of a technical team.

### Justification
I have exhibited this skill over the course of my time in the LevelTen energy engagement. Successfully leading three junior developers. Breaking down and assigning task to help them onboard the project successfully as well as ensuring each task has clearly defined expectations. I also ensure I get a good sense of where junior developers are with the task they are working on and if there any blockers so that I can better manage expectations and also offer help when needed. I have also tried to lead by setting good example for all to follow bringing my knowledge of what different stakeholders expects from us as a team and ensuring that we all learn from mistakes as well.
