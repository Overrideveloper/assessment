# Self Awareness

### Expectation
The Developer has a strong awareness of self and seeks feedback from others regarding their actions and behaviours. They continuously seek to improve weak areas. They make efforts to understand the behaviours of those around them, and make effective use of this understanding.

### Justification
I constantly engage in self examination and also seek feedback from both my TSM and members of my team on areas which I can improve on and become better at them. I ensure I am aware of the expectations of all stakeholders on the team from me.

On my current engagement I pioneered the start of a self reflection meeting between all the members of my team. Where we are able to share feedback on our current process.
Here is a [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZR5r5YIIQ8TIYcwkVnXJH0Do07hwnEk6?usp=sharing) to one of such reflection.
