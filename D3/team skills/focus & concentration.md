# Focus & Concentration

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of the team and knows how to keep his team focused on the client's top priorities but also knows when to stop pushing to avoid team or individual burnout.

### Justification
As a senior member of my team, I make sure our product management board is always tidy and tickets are arranged in other of priority. I also engage in conversations with junior members of the team in order to get their understanding of the tickets they are working on and ensure they know the priorities of the team or any particular ticket. I also leverage on the information given on standup to understand if each junior member is working at the right pace and try to lift burden from any of them if I notice that any task is proving to be too weighty for any.

I also try to shield the team from too many requests coming in-between sprint and also ensure our project co-ordinator understands the cost implications of adding more tickets to the current sprint and try to push for her to add such tickets to the backlog instead.
