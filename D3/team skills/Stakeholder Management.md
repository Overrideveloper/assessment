# Stakeholder Management

### Expectation
The Developer includes junior members of their team as stakeholders and understands how to appropriately communicate the right level of information to them.

### Justification
I have actively portrayed this skill on my current engagement when taking charge of breaking down tickets to include the right level of detail necessary for junior developers to complete the task.
I have a [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zSmUYlVydcurS4IM4cCTIyF_I7MQHuFn) to a video of me breaking down task and adding necessary information for anyone who is going to work on them.
