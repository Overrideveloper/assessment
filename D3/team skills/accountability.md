# Accountability

### Expectation
The Developer guides others on the team about the importance of taking responsibility and accounting for one's actions.

### Justification
Accountability is the ability of myself and team members to give account of our activities, accept responsibilities when things go wrong and ensure we are always on top of any situation that arises in the course of our work. I ensure we take ownership of the project by taking full responsibility of tasks that needs to be worked on. I encourage everyone to own up when mistakes are made and aid collaborative effort towards making it right.
