# Empathy

### Expectation
The Developer is sensitive to the feelings, thoughts and experiences of people on their team. They also guide other members of their team to consider and respond appropriately to the needs and feelings of different people in different situations.

### Justification
I believe I demonstrated this skill when I endorsed the decision of my TSM to permit the SC on my engagement to work from home on some days due to the heavy traffic he faces coming to work and going back home which can be very tedious.

There was also a situation where myself and a junior developer on my engagement had to work on a part of the codebase that was very fragile. After making my changes and submitting my PR, while the junior developer was making his own changes he found that some of his changes were also going to break mine. I knew he had really worked hard, staying up late at night to finish up the task. So I asked that he submit his PR and just make sure his own changes works for his ticket and I would work to ensure I fix my own ticket in such a way that it won't break his.
