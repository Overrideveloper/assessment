# Vision Alignment

### Expectation
The Developer is able to articulate their company's vision and understands how their work helps the company achieve their goals.

### Justification
LevelTen Energy's vision is to have a standardised energy market where small C&I customers have access to the same projects/portfolios afforded to the worlds largest energy buyers. Ensure energy buyers have access to the best tools possible to forecast/monitor energy projects/assets in much less time.

I have had the opportunity to contribute to the RFP automation process software as well as assets performance monitoring which as certainly brought LevelTen closer to the future.
