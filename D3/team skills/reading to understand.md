# Reading to Understand

### Expectation
The Developer is able to identify and convey the key points of material and content read. They are adept at reading documentation, code, or emails and deriving all required information from them.

### Justification

Some feature requirement are often communicated via google docs/ spreadsheet which I read carefully to understand and ask questions to clarify any aspect that seem confusing to me.

I have also had to implement feature which required me to read documentations such as Highcharts/Highmaps for drawing svg maps and charts.

Below are links to Screenshot of sample documents used to convey key feature requirement. https://drive.google.com/open?id=1N7GrsWULKWUKg_zsH4olZGDl_UCj7EPH
