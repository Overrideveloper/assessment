# Relationship Building

### Expectation
The Developer has the ability to establish themselves as a trusted advisor to their company. Leadership sees them as having the company's best interest at hand and capable of giving unbiased advice.

### Justification
I believe relationship building involves building social connections, mutual trust and understanding with my partner and co-worker.
In the course of my current engagement, I demonstrate this skill by asking questions that helps me better understand my partners needs and expectation so as to work towards meeting those needs. I also engage in conversations regarding the business model, the short and long term objectives of the company and how we intend to achieve them. I also ensure I give ASK feedback regarding our work process.
