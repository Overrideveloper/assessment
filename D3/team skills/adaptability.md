# Adaptability

### Expectation
The Developer is able to help other members of their team adapt to change and recognise its value.

### Justification
On my current engagement, I have had to help both junior and senior developers onboard the code base. All of whom had their ideas of how things should be and what tools should have been better to work with. Been a lot familiar with the code base I help them understand how it's impossible and counter productive to make those changes now and help them understand and get familiar with the tools been used currently. I also try to help them technically when they have any blockers and also ensure I give feedback in PR code reviews to been get better.

An example and one I frequently got from all Andela developers who I helped on-board the code base was our use of PrimeUI css framework in favour of the more popular Bootstrap or Material css framework. I have had sessions with them explaining how to use difficult aspects of it such as understanding and using its grid system.
