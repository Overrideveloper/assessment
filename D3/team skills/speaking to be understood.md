# Speaking to be Understood

### Evidence
The Developer speaks in a manner (audibility, pace) that allows others to engage and understand. They are able to rephrase a concept using different perspectives or vocabulary in order to exhibit a thorough understanding of the subject. The Developer can present important information to teams and stakeholders they interact with frequently.

### Justification

On my current engagement, I have been opportuned to enhance this skill through the follow avenues;
1. Daily standup - For a while following the addition of new developers to my engagement I was the one leading standing up and ensuring the partner has a clear understanding of the the progress made on features we are working on.

2. Demos - Also leading some demos to key stakeholders to properly demonstrate progress to key features.

3. Backlog grooming -  I have also had the opportunity to lead Backlog grooming meetings where key features are broken down and requirement explained to all developers on my team.
