# Team Dynamics

### Expectation
The Developer understands their expanded role as a senior member of a team and how they are responsible not only for their own individual contributions, but mentoring other team members to increase the overall effectiveness of the team.

### Justification
On my current engagement, Though we currently have a D3(SC) on the engagement as well as other junior members on team. I am the longest serving member on the team, offering my wealth of experience about the code base. I have been saddled with the responsibility of reviewing both the PR of the SC as well as that of other junior members of the team. I also endorse or advise against taking any action that might be detrimental to the teams effectiveness. I have essentially been partnering with the SC in improving the teams effectiveness.
